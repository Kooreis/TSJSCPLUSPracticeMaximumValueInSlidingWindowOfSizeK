# Question: How do you find the maximum value in each sliding window of size k? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided defines a Deque class and a function named `maxSlidingWindow`. The Deque class is a double-ended queue data structure that allows adding and removing elements from both ends. The `maxSlidingWindow` function is designed to find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` in an array of numbers. It first checks if the array is empty or if `k` is larger than the array's length, returning an empty array in either case. It then uses two loops to iterate over the array. The first loop initializes the deque with the first `k` elements of the array, always ensuring that the maximum value is at the front of the deque. The second loop starts from the `k`th element and continues to the end of the array. In each iteration, it adds the maximum value of the current window to the result array, removes elements that are out of the current window from the front of the deque, and removes elements that are smaller than the current element from the rear of the deque. Finally, it adds the current element to the rear of the deque. After the loop, it adds the maximum value of the last window to the result array. The function then returns the result array, which contains the maximum values of all sliding windows of size `k` in the array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version, but with some differences in the implementation.

1. TypeScript uses static typing: In the TypeScript version, types are explicitly declared for variables and function return values. For example, the `nums` parameter in the `maxSlidingWindow` function is declared as a number array (`number[]`), and the function is declared to return a number array (`number[]`). This can help prevent type-related errors and improve code readability and maintainability.

2. Simplified Deque class: The TypeScript version simplifies the Deque class into a `SlidingWindowMax` class with only three methods: `push`, `max`, and `pop`. This class maintains a deque where the maximum value is always at the front. The `push` method adds a value to the deque and ensures the deque is in descending order. The `max` method returns the maximum value (the first element in the deque), and the `pop` method removes a value from the front of the deque if it matches the specified value.

3. Different logic in `maxSlidingWindow` function: The TypeScript version uses a slightly different logic in the `maxSlidingWindow` function. It always pushes the current number into the `SlidingWindowMax` object, and if the window size is reached, it pushes the maximum value into the result array and pops the number that is no longer in the window from the `SlidingWindowMax` object.

4. Use of `const` for variable declaration: The TypeScript version uses `const` to declare variables that are not reassigned, which can make the code safer by preventing unintentional reassignments.

Overall, the TypeScript version is more concise and type-safe compared to the JavaScript version, while solving the problem in a similar way.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions use a Deque data structure to keep track of the maximum value in each sliding window of size k. The main difference between the two versions is the language syntax and the way they handle the Deque data structure.

In the JavaScript version, a Deque class is created with methods to add and remove elements from both ends of the deque, check if the deque is empty, and get the size of the deque. The `maxSlidingWindow` function then uses these methods to find the maximum value in each sliding window.

In the C++ version, the `std::deque` from the Standard Template Library (STL) is used. This deque already has methods to add and remove elements from both ends (`push_back`, `pop_back`, `push_front`, `pop_front`), and to access the first and last elements (`front`, `back`). The `printMax` function uses these methods in a similar way to the JavaScript version to find the maximum value in each sliding window.

Another difference is that the C++ version prints each maximum value as it is found, whereas the JavaScript version stores all the maximum values in an array and returns this array at the end.

Finally, the C++ version uses a `std::vector` to store the input array, whereas the JavaScript version uses a standard JavaScript array. The `std::vector` in C++ is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size, similar to a JavaScript array.
